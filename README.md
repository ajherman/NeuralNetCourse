# NeuralNetCourse

This repo's for developing course material for the SYSC neural nets class.  I'd like to set it up so that the master branch (only) is accessible to students, and all day by day work we do is restricted to branches off of dev.  I think that will make it easier if we need to make changes while the class is running for any reason.
